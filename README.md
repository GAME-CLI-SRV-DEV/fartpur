Why Purpur is terrible replacement for Paper

# READ:
to make sure youhavetrouble and euphilla leave from purpurmc, i am going to teach them why Purpur is idiotic and terrible PaperMC Replacement!

# Why Purpur Sucks:

### Does Not Support Geyser
PurpurMC Should Merged PR #1525: according to encode42, Minecraft Split into 2 Editions, which is Java and Bedrock!
But we have also a GeyserMC! and we use GeyserMC For Functions! i have to wait until version is merged after the update!
But If They Switched to NogyangSpigot fork then 2 Edition could've met, But [granny](https://github.com/granny) blocked me from answering after that!
This is very racist + ratio + ohio
#BedrockLivesMatter

# Alternative:
You Should Use PlazmaMC And PatinaMC since they have Purpur Functions.
if you want to use both, you should consider Radioactive.
