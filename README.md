Why Purpur devs are rude

# READ:
The Purpur Function is okay but i swear that the developers doesn't support Bedrock I Tell You! 

# Why Purpur Sucks:

### Does Not PRovide Geyser-Friendly Functions
PurpurMC Should Merged PR #1525: according to encode42, Minecraft Split into 2 Editions, which is Java and Bedrock!
But we have also a GeyserMC! and we use GeyserMC For Functions! i have to wait until version is merged after the update!
But If They Switched to NogyangSpigot fork then 2 Edition could've met with friendly environment, But [granny](https://github.com/granny) blocked me from answering after that!
This is very Purpuracist + purpuratio + Purfohiormance

### Made an ohioan server
They Made Purformance, but i can tell you that Purformance should rewritten it with MultiNet Codebase! because without Multinet This Looks More Like we are running this in Ohio! Yes! I Am Not Kidding!

Purformance is just more like Ohioan Minestom Clone! Seriously! They could have made new one! Oh, it's showing off all possiblities of made in ohio Server Software!

# Alternative:
You Should Use PlazmaMC And PatinaMC since they have Purpur Functions.
if you want to use both, you should consider Radioactive. 
For Purformance, use MultiNet Based Fork. (WIP)
Multinet is trying to support Floodgate-core. Please Stand By.
From Now On, if you want to access org.bukkit.craftbukkit.main-like class, use org.MultiNet.MultiBukkit.main. a Bukkit API Implementation On Minestom.
